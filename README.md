This extension helps with annoying or resource-consuming elements on web pages - by removing them.

See `jobs` array for the first example - a job that clears "Live spaces" list from every Twitter page (section in the right column). Elements used for tracking and displaying active participants in the spaces for some reason consume enourmous amount of resources (at least in Chrome in Linux).
